                Egyptian civilization developed along the Nile River in large part because the river’s annual flooding 
                ensured reliable, rich soil for growing crops.
                Repeated struggles for political control of Egypt showed the importance of the region's agricultural 
                production and economic resources.
                The Egyptians kept written records using a writing system known as hieroglyphics.
                Egyptian rulers used the idea of divine kingship and constructed monumental architecture to demonstrate and maintain power.
                Ancient Egyptians developed wide-reaching trade networks along the Nile, in the Red Sea, and in the Near East.

                  Much of the history of Egypt is divided into three “kingdom” periods—Old,
                  Middle, and New—with shorterintermediate periods separating the kingdoms.
                  The term "intermediate" here refers to the fact that during these times
                  Egypt was not a unified political power, and thus was in between powerful kingdoms.
                  Even before the Old Kingdom period, the foundations of 
                  Egyptian civilization were being laid for thousands of years, as people 
                  living near the Nile increasingly focused on sedentary agriculture, which
                  led to urbanization and specialized, non-agricultural economic activity.

               <p class="pargragh">             
            Egypt is a land of duality and cycles, both in topography and culture.
            The geography is almost entirely rugged, barren desert, except for an explosion of green 
            that straddles either side of the Nile as it flows the length of the country.
            The river emerges from far to the south, deep in Africa, and empties into the Mediterranean sea in the north after spreading 
            from a single channel into a fan-shaped system, known as a delta, at its northernmost section.
            The influence of this river on Egyptian culture and development cannot be overstated—without its presence,
            the civilization would have been entirely different, and most likely entirely elsewhere. 
            The Nile provided not only a constant source of life-giving water, but created the fertile lands 
            that fed the growth of this unique (and uniquely resilient) culture.
